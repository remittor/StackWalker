# StackWalker - Walking the callstack

This article describes the (documented) way to walk a callstack for any thread (own, other and remote). It has an abstraction layer, so the calling app does not need to know the internals.

This project was initially published on Codeproject (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/threads/StackWalker.aspx). 
But it is hard to maintain the article and the source on codeproject, 
so I was pushed to publish the source code on an "easier to modify" platform. Therefor I have choosen "codeplex" ;(

But time goes by, and codeplex went away ;)

So I now migrated to GutHub ;)
